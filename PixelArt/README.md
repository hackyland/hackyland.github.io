# Workshop: Creating Pixel Art
This workshop allows students to create some pixel art graphics and animations with [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com). Students will be able to update a [JavaScript Game](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/hh25-platformer) with their own assets (based on [this tutorial](https://mozdevs.github.io/html5-games-workshop/)), or they can simply use the tool to build whatever they like.

## Agenda

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Pixel Art Examples | 5m |
| Piskel Demo | 15m |
| Game Animation Follow-Along | 20m |
| Challenges | 20m |

## Outline
The workshop consists of these parts.

### Pixel Art Examples
Briefly show [some examples](PixelArtExamples.md) of what is possible with pixel art.

### Piskel Demo
Go through [demo guide](PiskelDemo.md) to demonstrate the use of Piskel. Show some of the tools and capabilities of the app, and allow the students to create some art of their own after introducing the concepts.

Some students may wish to continue using Piskel for the entire time - that's totally fine!

### Game Animation Follow-Along
Walk through the instructions on [this page](GameAnimation.md) to update some art for an existing platformer game. Students will remix the [existing game](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/hh25-platformer) and play it. Then, they  will take the [existing player walk cycle](player.png) and modify it in Piskel. Then, they will put the updated player animation in the game.

### Challenges
Give the students some time to work on the [challenges](AnimationChallenges.md). They can work on animations in Piskel, replacing game art, updating game code, or anything else they'd like.
