# Video Editing
Welcome to the wonderful world of editing.

## Introduction
The film editors are the ones who actually _make_ movies. They take the source material (raw footage, sound, titles) and turn it into the final product (an actual film). Here are some fun videos to introduce the ideas of editing (from a cinematic perspective):

## Recommendations
As you edit your videos, here are some things to keep in mind:

- Be creative
  - Put your own spin on your video and make it unique
- Use your personality
  - We want to see YOU in your video in addition to the project
- Keep it engaging with music, transitions, or graphics
  - This can help your artifact stand out!
- Be aware of the time crunch
  - Projects must be submitted by 5PM on Sunday
  - Don't worry about making it perfect, just make sure you submit something!

Remember, editing can totally make or break a project. Good luck!
