## Big Prize - File Cabinet
The **Hack Heist File Cabinet** is filled with secret treasure of untold wonder and delight. To unlock this cabinet, you must use the key that is hidden within the **Tagout Box**. The Tagout Box itself is secured by EIGHT (8) padlocks, each requiring its own key.

The game is simple: find all eight keys, unlock the big prize in the file cabinet.

## Free Keys
Six (6) of the eight padlock keys are floating as _primary targets_ - they are not locked behind additional keys or codes. These keys are as follows:

### Explorer's Keys (2)
These two keys are hidden somewhere in the building. They are in plain sight (classic Egg Hunt rules), and they are within the designated areas of the event.

>IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not go looking for the Explorer's Keys beyond the event perimeter! You won't find them, and you will also get in trouble.

### Mentor's Keys (2)
These two keys are held by the mentors. They must be attained through social engineering - e.g., you have to write a nice hand-written Thank You note to a mentor or a group of mentors. After an individual has received one of these keys, neither they themselves nor other members of their team are eligible to receive the next one.

### The Keys of the Chosen Ones (2)
These two keys are given to randomly selected students. Could it be that you already have a key, and you don't even realize it? Perhaps.

## Boxed Keys
For the remaining two (2) keys, there is an additional layer of security - as well as additional rewards.

### Scavenger's Key
The Scavenger's Key lies within a box, locked by a combination padlock. The combination will only be revealed after finding all the keywords hidden throughout the event, and entered into the [online portal](https://hackyland.onrender.com/key-of-the-scavenger).

These keywords will be discoverable by exploring the content on the website, by attending sessions, by participating in activities, and experimenting with code examples online.

Upon finding all of the keywords and receiving the combination, a participant (or group of participants) can unlock the box to attain the Scavenger's Key, along with an additional intermediary reward.

### Puzzler's Key
Like the scavenger's key, this is a box locked by a combination padlock. Each individual number for the combination can be found by completing the four paper puzzles, supplied during the Hacky Hour session. When solved, each puzzle will reveal one of the numbers for the combination.

## Conclusion
Best of luck - happy heisting!
