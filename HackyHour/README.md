# Hacky Hour
During the Hacky Hour, there is not too much to present. The biggest thing is introducing the Hack Heist with more specificity using the [Hack Heist Explainer](HackHeistExplainer.md) page. There are some specific things to explore on the [homepage](Home.md) that will lead to some answers.

Also, print out copies of the [Puzzler's Puzzles](Puzzler's%20Puzzles.docx) document to hand out to the students.

Participants can also play the [Merge Blocks](https://merge-blocks.glitch.me/) game linked from the [homepage](Home.md), but it will not help them with the Hack Heist.
