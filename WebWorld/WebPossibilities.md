# Web Possibilities
You can do so much with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are a few examples of what's possible.

>Keep in mind that if you use starter code for your final project, you **must** ensure your work is ultimately original. You should build significantly on the starting point, and make something that is totally unique to you and your team.

## Creative Coding with p5.js and OpenProcessing
[p5.js](https://p5.js) is a friendly tool for learning to code and make art. It is a free and open-source JavaScript library built by an inclusive, nurturing community. p5.js welcomes artists, designers, beginners, educators, and anyone else!

[Click here to check out some of the wild possibilities of p5.js on OpenProcessing.](https://openprocessing.org/discover/#/trending)

The coolest thing about these projects is that they are all open source - that means you can look at the code, and even copy it for your own project!

There are also some smaller examples to help you start coding with Processing.

### Example: Embers

### Example: Image Generator
[Click here to view the Image Generator.](https://editor.p5js.org/jsmaxwelldev/sketches/fCWaCRQf-)

There's actually something wrong with this one! See if you can fix the error. Then, run the project, and click the screen to generate some randomized images.

### Example: Waves


## 3D Worlds with A-Frame
It is surprisingly easy to start building a 3D world on the web. [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) is a great tool for doing so, and you can create without ever leaving an **index.html** file.

They even have a starter project on Glitch - [click here for the introduction](https://aframe.io/docs/1.6.0/introduction/)!

A-Frame is built on top of [three.js](https://threejs.org/), an easy-to-use, lightweight, cross-browser, general-purpose 3D library.

## Games with Phaser
[Phaser](https://phaser.io/) is a game development framework that works with JavaScript.

There's a [great book](https://glitch-game-makers-manual.glitch.me/) that introduces game development concepts using Phaser and Glitch - [click here for the web version of this in-depth walkthrough.](https://glitch-game-club.github.io/3m/)

## More
There is so much more to explore - these are just a few options. Find a cool project, let it inspire you, and build something amazing!
