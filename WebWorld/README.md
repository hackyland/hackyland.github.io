This workshop introduces students to the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Glitch.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Create and modify projects using Glitch
- Build their own custom websites
- Explore resources for further learning
- Recognize the power of web technologies
- Understand the possibilities of web development
- Be empowered to create substantial websites

## Outline
The workshop consists of these parts:

### Introduction
Present the [PowerPoint Presentation](WebWorldPresentation.pptx) to explain the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Code-Along
Follow the [code-along](WebWorldCodeAlong.md) instructions to help each participant build up a simple website about a topic of their choosing.

### Possibilities & Resources
Go over the [possibilities](WebPossibilities.md) and [resources](WebResources.md) with the participants. They should have a good idea of next steps by the end of this portion. This can also be an excellent time to encourage the students to think of ideas based on what they've seen.

### Customization
Participants can have some time to work on their websites as they choose. They are welcome to follow the [customization instructions](Customization.md), explore the [resources](WebResources.md) and [possibilities](WebPossibilities.md), or do anything else.

### Formative Assessment: Blooket
With any time that remains, facilitate the [Blooket quiz game](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/674479b2ed834c3175d9d560).

End the workshop with a few words of encouragement for the students. They should feel empowered to go out and code something fun, unique, and rewarding.
